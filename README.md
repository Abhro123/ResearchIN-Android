# ResearchIN
ResearchIN is an easy to use application where Researchers and other people interested in research works can register, by providing certain details, some of which are prebuilt in the system, their interests as well. They can view other peopleâ€™s works in their feed if the interests match with the works, can upload their own works and also specify if they want to make their works public or hidden for security purposes. Users can follow other registered users or researchers if they want, can request to download full papers if the interested papers are locked, can search papers based on paper names, some keywords or even author names and can also find registered users if they are nearby each other.
